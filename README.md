    3.  Place the downloaded `SC3Plugins` folder into:
    `~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/`
    *(You may need to create the `Extensions` folder if it doesn't exist).*
    4.  Recompile the class library in SuperCollider (`Cmd+Shift+L`).
- [x] **Directory Structure:** Requires `core/`, `gui/`, `material/`, `io/`, `presets/`, and `samples/` relative to `main.scd`
## 🔥 LATEST SESSION UPDATES (Feb 21, 2026)

### ✅ NEW WORKING FEATURES

**Phase 19: Unified Tape Rate (Varispeed)**
- Unified `tapeRate` parameter linking speed + pitch across all engines
- Works on Direct, Granular, and Spectral engines simultaneously
- Formula: `pitch_semitones = 12 * log2(rate)`
- Hardware sampler-style behavior (0.5x = half speed/-12 semitones, 2.0x = double/+12st)
- Test: `tests/tape-rate-test.scd`

**Phase 20: Waveform Display Enhancement**
- View-relative playhead coordinates (all 5 playhead types: grain, spectral, direct, recording, pulse)
- Auto-zoom to loop selection when user finishes dragging
- ZOOM FULL button (created, not visually appearing - see Known Issues)
- Implemented with Gemini AI consultation for coordinate system design

**Bug Fixes - FULLY RESOLVED**
- ✅ KeyStep Connect button placement (moved to SYNC Manager section for proper clustering)
- ✅ TAP TEMPO BPM display sync (live updates when tap button pressed)
- ✅ RESET PARAMS comprehensive (61 parameters + all 4 modulators cleanup)
- ✅ Syntax errors: var declarations, missing braces, window height

### ⚠️ KNOWN BROKEN FEATURES

**Vocoder (Harmonium Integration)**
- Symptom: All sound stops when vocoder START button pressed
- Attempted fix: Corrected variable naming (`directSynth` → `directPlaybackSynth`)
- Status: Partial fix applied; root cause of audio cutoff remains unknown
- Blocking: Requires deep investigation of track hijacking logic and audio routing
- Workaround: Use grain/spectral/direct engines independently without vocoder

## QUICK START

### Step 1: Boot the SuperCollider Server

**IMPORTANT**: Before running `main.scd`, you need to boot the audio server. Different systems require different setups:

#### Mac (Built-in Audio)
```supercollider
// Default Mac audio - just boot it
s.boot;
```

#### Mac with Audio Interface (MOTU, Focusrite, etc.)
```supercollider
// Option 1: Use your interface as default
s.boot;

// Option 2: Explicitly select your interface
(
Server.default = Server.local;
s.options.device = "MOTU UltraLite mk4";  // <- Change to YOUR interface name
s.boot;
)

// To see all available devices:
ServerOptions.devices;
```

#### Linux (JACK or ALSA)
```supercollider
// JACK (recommended for low latency)
(
Server.default = Server.local;
s.options.device = "JackRouter";
s.boot;
)

// ALSA (simpler setup)
s.boot;  // Uses default ALSA device
```

#### Windows (ASIO or MME)
```supercollider
// ASIO (recommended - low latency)
(
Server.default = Server.local;
s.options.device = "ASIO : Your Interface Name";  // e.g., "ASIO : Focusrite USB"
s.boot;
)

// To see all available devices:
ServerOptions.devices;
```

### Step 2: Wait for Boot Confirmation
Look for this in the Post window:
```
*** Welcome to SuperCollider 3.14.1 ***
Server 'localhost' running.
```

### Step 3: Run Main
```supercollider
// Execute this file
"main.scd".loadRelative;
```

The GUI will open automatically!

## WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

### 4 Track Tabs
- **TRACK 1-4**: Full granular synthesis controls per track
  - Load audio files or record live input
  - Grain engine (size, overlap, position, pitch)
  - Color FX (distortion, bit crusher, compression, noise)
  - Space FX (reverb, delay, shimmer)
  - Loop window selector (drag waveform to set loop points)

### Master Tab
- **PLAY ALL / STOP ALL**: Global transport
- **GLOBAL SPEED**: Control pitch of all tracks at once
- **TRACK OVERVIEW**: Quick mix controls + VU meters
- **CPU MONITOR**: Keep it green!

---

## BASIC WORKFLOW

### 1. Load Audio into Track 1
1. Click **TRACK 1** tab
2. Click **Load Audio File**
3. Navigate to `samples/stock/` and load one of these:
   - **a11wlk01.wav** - "Columbia, this is Houston" (Apollo 11 mission audio)
   - **a11wlk01-44_1.aiff** - Same audio, different format
   - **SinedPink.aiff** - Synthetic test tone
4. Click **PLAY** to hear grains

**Pro tip**: The Apollo 11 sample is PERFECT for granular processing - try tiny grain sizes (0.01s) for a frozen space transmission texture!

### 2. Sculpt the Grains
- **Grain Size**: How long each grain is (0.001s - 60s)
- **Overlap**: How many grains play at once (1-128)
- **Position**: Where in the buffer to read from (0-1)
- **Pitch**: Transpose in semitones (-24 to +24)

### 3. Set Loop Window
- Drag on the waveform display to select a region
- The grain engine will only play from this region
- Use arrow keys or mouse wheel to zoom

### 4. Add Effects
- **Color FX ON**: Enable distortion/crusher/noise chain
- **Space FX ON**: Enable reverb/delay/shimmer

### 5. Mix & Monitor
- Go to **MASTER** tab
- Adjust track volumes
- Watch VU meters (aim for green/yellow, avoid red)
- Keep CPU below 50% average

### 6. Save Your Work (Phase 14!)
```supercollider
// Save current state as a preset
~presets.save("mySound");

// Load it later
~presets.load("mySound");

// Or try example presets
"examples/preset-examples.scd".loadRelative;  // Creates 10 example presets
~presets.list;                                  // See all presets
~presets.load("ambient_pad");                   // Load ambient preset
```

---

## ESSENTIAL SC COMMANDS

See `generic-commands.scd` for a full cheat sheet. Here are the must-knows:

### Emergency Stop
```supercollider
Cmd-.    // Mac
Ctrl-.   // Windows/Linux
// Kills all sound immediately!
```

### Server Management
```supercollider
s.boot;          // Start server
s.reboot;        // Restart clean
s.quit;          // Shut down
s.freeAll;       // Kill all synths but keep server running
```

### Monitoring
```supercollider
s.meter;         // Audio level meters
s.scope;         // Oscilloscope
s.plotTree;      // See all running synths
s.avgCPU;        // Check CPU usage
```

### Volume Control
```supercollider
s.volume = -20;  // Set output volume in dB
s.mute;          // Mute all output
s.unmute;        // Unmute
```

---

## MATERIAL MODES (Phase 6)

Each track has 3 material modes:

1. **TAPE (Loop)**: Classic looping granular synthesis
   - Good for: Ambient textures, pitch shifting loops

2. **POLY (Sample)**: One-shot sample playback per grain
   - Good for: Rhythmic glitches, stutters

3. **LIVE (Input)**: Real-time granulation of live audio input
   - Good for: Live processing, feedback loops

---

##  TROUBLESHOOTING

### No Sound?
1. Check server is booted: `s.serverRunning`
2. Check volume isn't muted: `s.volume`
3. Hit **PLAY** button (tracks start STOPPED by default)
4. Check audio interface is selected correctly
5. Verify your interface is powered on and connected

### Audio Crackling?
1. Check CPU usage (Master tab)
2. Increase server buffer size:
   ```supercollider
   s.quit;
   s.options.blockSize = 256;  // or 512, 1024
   s.boot;
   ```

### GUI Looks Weird?
- Make sure you have **DejaVu Sans Mono** font installed
- Or edit `gui/four-track-view.scd` to use a different monospace font

### Recording Too Quiet?
- Input is boosted 3x automatically
- Check your interface's input gain
- Try the Input selector (In 1-8) to choose the right channel

## STOCK SAMPLES

The `samples/stock/` folder includes some great starter material:

### Apollo 11 Mission Audio
- **a11wlk01-44_1k.aiff** - "Columbia, this is Houston..."
- Classic mission control transmission
- Perfect for granular processing - rich textures with voice, static, and space
- Try these settings:
  - Grain Size: 0.01s → frozen space transmission
  - Position: 0.3-0.7 → scan through the transmission
  - Pitch: -12 → deep space drone
  - Reverb Mix: 0.8 + Freeze: 1.0 → infinite space

### Test Tone
- **SinedPink.aiff** - Sine wave + pink noise blend
- Good for testing effects and understanding parameters
- Less exciting than Apollo 11 but useful for calibration

**Want more samples?** Drop any WAV/AIFF files into the samples folders!

## KNOWN ISSUES & STATUS

### 🚨 Critical Issues (Blocking Features)

**Vocoder Feature - BROKEN**
- All audio stops when vocoder START button is pressed
- Partial fix applied to variable naming but root cause unknown
- Root causes to investigate:
  - Track hijacking logic in `track-manager.scd` lines 579-625
  - Audio bus routing to Harmonium input bus
  - Synth initialization order in audio graph
  - See `HARMONIUM-DIAGNOSIS.md` for debugging checklist
- Workaround: Use grain/spectral/direct engines independently

### ⚠️ Visual/Display Issues

**ZOOM FULL Button - Not Visible**
- Button created and added to viewfinder window (line 1205)
- Button logic functional but not rendering visually
- Likely causes: Layout/rendering issue, button positioning off-screen, or container size
- Workaround: Use arrow keys and mouse wheel to zoom waveform manually

**ZOOM FULL Button (Phase 20)**
- Created but not visually appearing (see above)

### 📋 Minor Issues (Functional Workarounds Exist)

- Waveform display uses temp files for recorded buffers (functional but inefficient)
- Modulation window is a separate popup (not integrated into main tabbed interface)
- Some GUI elements may overlap in Master tab (layout cleanup in progress)
- Recording playhead may not advance visually during capture (audio works correctly)

---

## YES YES YES!

Granular synthesis is all about exploration.

- Try tiny grain sizes (0.001s) for frozen textures
- Try huge grain sizes (10s+) for slow morphing
- Crank overlap to 128 for dense clouds
- Use 1 overlap for clean playback
- Record your output and feed it back in!
